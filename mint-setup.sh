# The purpose of this script is to call other github/chaslinux scripts we use to deploy a user-friendly
# version of Linux Mint, complete with extra software we think will be handy to end users, as well as
# a script to detect the system's hardware, and run a couple of benchmarks: geekbench6, and yaquake2.
#
# NOTE: do not run this script with sudo, but you should be a user with sudo access, it will prompt you
# for your password in order to install software.
# 
# In other words, just enter the directory this file is in and type: ./mint-setup.sh
